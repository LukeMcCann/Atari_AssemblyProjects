Assembly Language is a low-level programming language
designed for a particular processor. Assembly Language
can be produced by compiling source code from
high-level languages but can also be (and has been in the past)
written by hand. 

Most modern compilers convert source code directly to machine code,
hence modern developers use high-level abstraction languages to
create programs without the need for writing assembly code.

Assembly code can however be useful for fine-tuning efficiency.

Assembly Language differs between processor architectures,
however often includes similar instructions accross the
board:

X86 processor example:

    MOV - move data from one location to another
    ADD - add two values
    SUB - subtract a value from another value
    PUSH - push data onto a stack
    POP - pop data from a stack
    JMP - jump to another location
    INT - interrupt a process
